# Awwwards replica 

This is a teamwork, from the CodeCool's Frontend Developer Course.
According to the task we should choose a website from awwwards.com and we had to copy it.
The animations were the main points. We didn't have to replicate the whole page, just a part of it.

Our chosen website was STEINA, and I loved to work on it, because this was a CSS oriented exercise, so this was my turn to show my skills, and what have I learned so far.

At this time we used only pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.
